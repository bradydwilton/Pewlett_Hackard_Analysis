# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

Pewlett Hackard, a large company who has employed hundreds of thousands of people through its history, currently has a large number of retirement-age employees that it will soon need to replace. Unfortunately, Pewlett Hackard's current employee records system consists only of six disconnected CSV files, making it difficult for the company to forecast how many employees will need to be replaced and at what time. This analysis merges the six CSV files into a SQL database using PostgreSQL and will provide insight to the company as to how it should plan to keep the company running smoothly through the upcoming wave of retirements.


## Results

* There are 90,398 retirement age employees within the company
* Over half of the positions that will need to be filled are either senior engineer (32.5%) or senior staff (31.3%)
* Two of the nine department managers are of retirement age
* There are currently 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program

## Summary

### Retirees by Position 
As previously stated, the largest number of roles that will need to be replaced are senior engineer and senior staff. Additionally, the departments with the highest number of departures are from each deprtment are from the Development and Production departments. The following links show the full tables of both [retirees by department](https://github.com/bradydwilton/Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis_Project_Folder/Data/retiring_dept_count.csv) and [retirees by position within each department](https://github.com/bradydwilton/Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis_Project_Folder/Data/retiring_depts.csv).


### Mentorship Program
As compared to the over 90,000 retirement aged employees, there are only just over 1,500 employees who fit the criteria to be in the mentorship program. Consideration should be taken into expanding the requirements to include a larger age range of mentorship-eligible employees.
